FSharpLint
======

Attempt at a lint tool for F#.

So far nothing really seems to be out there for static analysis of code quality for F#, so I'm going to have a go at some basic functionality. 

Some documents to go off of:

FSharp guidelines: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/fsharp-component-design-guidelines.pdf
OCaml guidelines: http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html
Mascot (an OCaml lint) documentation: https://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/download.php/988/mascot.pdf
