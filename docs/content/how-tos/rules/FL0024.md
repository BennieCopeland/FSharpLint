# MaxLinesInValue (FL0024)

## Cause

A statement binded to a value is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.
For example the following would break the rule when the maximum number of lines is set to 4:

    let value =
		let x = 7
		let y = 6
		let e = 5
		let r = 4
		r * y * e * x

## Rationale

The larger a value becomes the more complex it becomes.

## How To Fix

Refactor to extract out code into smaller composable functions.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInValue": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100,
                "skipBlankLines": false,
                "skipComments": false
            }
        }
    }

*Introduced in `0.23.0`:*

The default setting will be false if the option is not provided in the Rule Settings:
* *skipBlankLines* - A boolean property that determines whether blank lines will be skipped. (Default false)
* *skipComments* - A boolean property that determines whether commented lines will be skipped. (Default false)
