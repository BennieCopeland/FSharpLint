# MaxLinesInFile (FL0062)

## Cause

More than a configurable number of lines were found in a file.

## Rationale

Too many lines in a file indicate it's becoming too complex.

## How To Fix

Refactor to extract code out into another file.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInFile": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLinesInFile": 1000,
                "skipBlankLines": false,
                "skipComments": false
            }
        }
    }

*Introduced in `0.23.0`:*

The default setting will be false if the option is not provided in the Rule Settings:
* *skipBlankLines* - A boolean property that determines whether blank lines will be skipped. (Default false)
* *skipComments* - A boolean property that determines whether commented lines will be skipped. (Default false)
