# FavourReRaise (FL0073)

*Introduced in `0.21.1`*

## Cause

An exception was re-thrown (re-raised) without the use of function `reraise()`.

## Rationale

Using `raise ex` (inside a try..with|ex` block) to re-raise an exception is not ideal, as it loses valuable stacktrace information from the original exception.

## How To Fix

Use `reraise()` instead of `raise ex`.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourReRaise": {
           "enabled": true
        }
    }
