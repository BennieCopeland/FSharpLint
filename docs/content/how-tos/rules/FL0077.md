# AvoidOnePipeOperator (FL0077)

*Introduced in `0.21.4`*

## Cause

Use of the pipe operator if it's only used once.

## Rationale

When invocation of the pipe operator is only once it doesn't aid readibility.
Example of undesired pipe operator usage: 
```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someParam
    |> someOtherFunc
```
Example of desired pipe operator usage:
```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someParam
    |> someOtherFunc
    |> yetAnotherFunc
```

## How To Fix

Use a normal function call:
```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someOtherFunc someParam
```

## Rule Settings

    {
        "avoidOnePipeOperator": { "enabled": true }
    }
