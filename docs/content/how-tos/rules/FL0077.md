# AvoidSinglePipeOperator (FL0077)

*Introduced in `0.21.5`*

## Cause

Use of the pipe operator when only one invocation is employed.

## Rationale

When the use of the pipe operator happens for a single invocation (instead of a multiple one, which would add a chain of them, usually staggered across 
many lines), it doesn't aid readibility.

Example of single pipe operator usage:

```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someParam
    |> someOtherFunc
```

Example of multiple pipe operator usage:

```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someParam
    |> someOtherFunc
    |> yetAnotherFunc
```

## How To Fix

Just use a normal function call, without the need for any operator:

```angular2html
let someFunc someParam =
    someOtherFunc someParam
```

## Rule Settings

    {
        "avoidOnePipeOperator": { "enabled": true }
    }
