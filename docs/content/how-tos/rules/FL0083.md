# UnneededRecKeyword (FL0083)

*Introduced in `0.23.1`*

## Cause

Recursive functions (functions with a "rec" keyword) does not call themselves.

## Rationale

Using "rec" keyword on a function that is not recursive is unnecessary.

## How To Fix

Update the function to call itself or remove "rec" keyword if that function doesn't need to call recursively.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "unneededRecKeyword": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
