# UnneededRecKeyword (FL0083)

*Introduced in `0.24.0`*

## Cause

Recursive function (function marked with a "rec" keyword) does not invoke itself.

## Rationale

Using "rec" keyword on a function that is not recursive is unnecessary.

## How To Fix

Update the function to invoke itself or remove "rec" keyword in case it doesn't need to invoke itself recursively.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "unneededRecKeyword": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
